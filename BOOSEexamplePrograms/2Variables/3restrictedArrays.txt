*restricted array example, you will need to replace the Array clas to get this to run.
int x = 0
real y
real z
array int nums 10
poke nums 5 = 99
peek x = nums 5
circle x
array real prices 10
poke prices 5 = 99.99
peek y = prices 5
pen 0,255,0
write "£"+y
array real logs 10
poke logs 5 = 100.001
peek z = logs 5
moveto 0,25
write z
